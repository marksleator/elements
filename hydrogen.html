        <h3>HYDROGEN</h3>
        <h4>THIS IS THE MOST ABUNDANT ELEMENT IN THE UNIVERSE.</h4>
        <div id="uses"><h4>USES</h4></div>
        <hr/>
        <p>Some see hydrogen gas as the clean fuel of the future – generated from water and 
            returning to water when it is oxidised. Hydrogen-powered fuel cells are increasingly 
            being seen as ‘pollution-free’ sources of energy and are now being used in some 
            buses and cars.</p>
        <p>Hydrogen also has many other uses. In the chemical industry it is used to make 
           ammonia for agricultural fertiliser (the Haber process) and cyclohexane and 
           methanol, which are intermediates in the production of plastics and 
            pharmaceuticals. It is also used to remove sulfur from fuels during the oil-refining
            process. Large quantities of hydrogen are used to hydrogenate oils to form fats, 
            for example to make margarine.</p>
        <p>In the glass industry hydrogen is used as a protective atmosphere for making flat
            glass sheets. In the electronics industry it is used as a flushing gas during the 
            manufacture of silicon chips.</p>
        <p>The low density of hydrogen made it a natural choice for one of its first practical 
            uses – filling balloons and airships. However, it reacts vigorously with oxygen 
            (to form water) and its future in filling airships ended when the Hindenburg airship 
            caught fire.</p>

        <h4>APPEARANCE</h4>
        <hr/>
        <p>A colourless, odourless gas. It has The lowest density of all gases. Hydrogen is easily 
            the most abundant element in the universe. It is found in the sun and most of the 
            stars, and the planet Jupiter is composed mostly of hydrogen.</p>

            <hr/></div>
        <p>In the early 1500s the alchemist Paracelsus noted that the bubbles given off when iron 
            filings were added to sulfuric acid were flammable. In 1671 Robert Boyle made the same 
            observation. Neither followed up their discovery of hydrogen, and so Henry Cavendish 
            gets the credit. In 1766 he collected the bubbles and showed that they were different 
            from other gases. He later showed that when hydrogen burns it forms water, thereby 
            ending the belief that water was an element. The gas was given its name hydro-gen, 
            meaning water-former, by Antoine Lavoisier.</p>
        <p>In 1931, Harold Urey and his colleagues at Columbia University in the US detected a 
            second, rarer, form of hydrogen. This has twice the mass of normal hydrogen, and they 
            named it deuterium.</p>
